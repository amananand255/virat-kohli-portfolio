# Virat Kohli Portfolio Website

This is a simple front-end project built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The website is a tribute-style portfolio for Virat Kohli and includes
different sections like career timeline, stats, gallery and a fan zone.

This project was built as a learning exercise to improve my front-end
development skills.
